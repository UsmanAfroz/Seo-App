## Free Guest Posting Opportunities (Quick Wins)

If you‚Äôre brand new to guest posting, the fastest way to start is by submitting to free contributor platforms. These communities accept writers with little barrier to entry, and while the domain authority (DA/DR) varies, they‚Äôre ideal for building your portfolio.

That said, don‚Äôt rely only on free sites. They‚Äôre great for practice, but the highest ROI comes from niche-relevant placements that your competitors actually read.

## How to Find Guest Post Sites with Google Search Operators

One of the easiest (and most overlooked) ways to uncover opportunities is to use Google‚Äôs advanced search operators. Here are five proven operators you can copy-paste right now:

"your niche" + "write for us"


"topic" + "guest post guidelines"


intitle:"guest post" + SaaS


inurl:guest-post + marketing


site:medium.com "guest post" + keyword


**Example (fitness niche):**

"fitness" + "write for us"
intitle:"guest post" + nutrition
inurl:guest-post + workout


These searches reveal pages where sites actively advertise contributor guidelines.

**Pro tip:** Once you find a potential site, plug it into Ahrefs, Semrush, or SE Ranking and check:
- Domain Rating (DR) or Authority Score  
- Organic traffic trends  
- Niche relevance

This helps you avoid low-quality sites that exist purely to sell links.

## Reverse-Engineer Competitor Backlinks

Another goldmine is analyzing where your competitors have already landed guest posts.

**Step 1: Identify competitors**  
Choose 3‚Äì5 websites in your niche with similar content or audience.

**Step 2: Run backlink analysis**  
Plug these competitors into Ahrefs, Semrush, or SE Ranking. Filter backlinks for anchors like ‚Äúguest post,‚Äù ‚Äúcontributed by,‚Äù or ‚Äúwrite for us.‚Äù

**Step 3: Build your list**  
Export those domains, filter out low-quality ones, and now you have a curated list of sites that already accept guest posts.

üëâ This method gives you a shortcut to proven, working opportunities.
